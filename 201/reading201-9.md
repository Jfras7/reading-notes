# Forms

- Forms work by, a user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server

- The name of each from control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters 

- The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database

- The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received 

## Lists, Tables and Forms

- list markers can be given different appearance's using the list style type and list style image
- table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browser but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent. 

- forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS

## Events

- Event bubbling: event starts at the most specific node and flows outwards to the least specific one

- Event Capturing: The event starts at the least specific node and flows inwards to the most specific one

- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element

- the most commonly used events are W3C DOM events
