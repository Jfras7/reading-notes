# CSS

> *You might ask yourself what is CSS?* A television network? Oh no, CSS is Cascading Style Sheets, which allows you to create great looking web pages. It allows what you see on web pages that are visually appealing. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users.

# Modules

> As you learn CSS you will discover that the language is broken down using modules. Which helps divide or separate areas. Which allows you to take on one specific area rather than a multiple of things which would result in it being either confusing or overwhelming. By doing this it also allows you to be able to pin point certain issues that you are having. As things are broke down in modules if there was an issue you wouldn't have to search your whole code for it as you would know the general area that is causing the issue.

*Three Ways to Insert CSS*

    1. External CSS (you can change the look of an entire website)
    1. Internal CSS (may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style)
    1. Inline CSS (may be used to apply a unique style for a single element)

## Cascading Order

    1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
    1. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
    1. Browser default
