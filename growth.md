# **Growth Mindset**
### Looking at Growth Mindset one of the first things that comes to mind is mental fortitude. Simply having the mental toughness to get through your situation without giving up. Growth Mindset to me is just that. Not giving in and constantly wanting to stay in the mindset of doing better and always wanting to learn. You have choices in life and they often come at times when you are not ready to make a choice but knowing and understanding of being in a fixed mindset and a growth mindset could make all the difference. 
# *3 Reminders for myself*
### ***1. Accept opportunities that push you out of your comfort zone â€“ remember challenges are chances to grow.*** This is something I struggle with. When things get a little tough I tend to get a little discourage. Making a mental note of this and going forward will not only help me during this time and process with my journy but allow me to push myself to greater heights and achieve goals and desires in which I thought was impossible. 
### ***2. Skills are built not born.*** A reminder that it takes time and dedication to learn and master something new. It does not come over night. 
### ***3. Mistakes are an important part of the process.*** I have to be able to accept that I will fail and make mistakes along the way. Which I don't want to look at that as a bad thing but more as an opportunity to grow and learn. As the great Denzel Washington once said "Nothing in life is worth while unless you take risks. Every failed experiment is one step closer to success."
