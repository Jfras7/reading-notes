# Web Pages With HTML

## Wireframe

What is wireframe you might ask? Wireframe to me is a simple thought, idea, brainstorm to paper or digital paper if you will. It's getting the idea that you have for a project down on paper in the simplest form to be able to create a bigger idea/project. Wireframe allows you to build the foundation of a app or webpage. It helps with getting out the thoughts to be able to move forward.

## HTML

Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML for short is the structure of a web page. Which allows you to enclose or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear in certain ways.

## Semantics

Semantics allows for the code to show you rather than looks. It would be something along the lines of when you hear the phrase of moving parts. It's giving something an action of movement rather than an action of eye candy.
