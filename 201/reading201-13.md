# The Past, Present & Future of Local Storage for Web Applications

- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over

- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)

- Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data â€” enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful

- Before HTML5, all attempts to achieve this were ultimately unsatisfactory in different ways.

- HTML5 storage is a way for web pages to store named key/value paris locally.
