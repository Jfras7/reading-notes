# CSS3

- When CSS3 arrived it came with new ways to position and alter elements. 

- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional

- One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations

- for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state

## Transform Syntax

- The actual syntax for the transform property. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses. 

## CSS3 Transitions 

- Fade in: fade in effects are coded in two steps

- Change color: just set the div’s class to “color” and specify the color we want in our CSS

- Grow & Shrink: Just have to use CSS3's transform to enlarge

- Rotate elements: one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element

- Square to circle: just transition the border-radius property

- 3D shadow: This effect is achieved by adding a box shadow, and then moving the element on the x axis using the transform and translate properties so that it appears to grow out of the screen

- Swing: create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration

- Inset border: ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border.

## Project Aristotle

- What I took away from it was the fact that in the work force we lose track of showing empathy and caring about one another. Todays companies push for numbers and forget their employees or act as if they are replaceable. Google spent millions over years to try and figure out the best way to get groups to mesh better. Countless amounts of data and time. Changing of groups and asking questions. Knowing and being proven that groups are much better and the increase in production shows it, but google could not figure it out fully. It basically came down to literally showing that you put back your fear of not putting on that "work face" and allowing yourself to be you when you show up. It takes others to do the same. In sense to show some vulnerability.
