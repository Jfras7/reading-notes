# CSS3

- When CSS3 arrived it came with new ways to position and alter elements. 

- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional

- One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations

- for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state

## Transform Syntax

- The actual syntax for the transform property. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses. 

## CSS3 Transitions 

- Fade in: fade in effects are coded in two steps

- Change color: just set the div’s class to “color” and specify the color we want in our CSS

- Grow & Shrink: Just have to use CSS3's transform to enlarge

- Rotate elements: one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element

- Square to circle: just transition the border-radius property

- 3D shadow: This effect is achieved by adding a box shadow, and then moving the element on the x axis using the transform and translate properties so that it appears to grow out of the screen

- Swing: create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration

- Inset border: ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border.
