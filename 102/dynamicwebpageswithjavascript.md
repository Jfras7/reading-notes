# JavaScript:
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language with first class functions. **(That seems like a lot of tech talk, lets break it down a little further)**

*JavaScript* is not what you installed on your computer to to watch a video. "Java" and "JavaScript" are two different languages. JavaScript is associated with HTML5. JavaScript is the programming language behind HTML5. JavaScript allows you to create web applications. 

**JavaScript Variables**
- [x] using `var`
- [x] using `let`
- [x] using `const`

- Variables are containers for storing data (values) 
*JavaScript Identifiers*
> All JavaScript variables must be **identified with unique names**, These unique names are called **Identifiers**
> Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age,sum,total volume)

### The general rules for constructing names for variables are:
1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
1. Names must begin with a letter
1. Names can also begin with $ and _ 
1. Names are case sensitive (Y and y are different variables)
1. Reserved words (Like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
