# **Revisions and the Cloud**

### **Version Control**
> Version control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. With version control you are able to revert a file or project to a previous version. Version Control allows for modification and modifying individuals and compare changes of files. 

### **Centralized Version Control**
> If you are ever apart of a team or work together with others you have "CVCS" to thank for that. It's a very important piece of sofware to allow team or group collaboration. This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.

### **Distributed Version Control**
> This system address the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point failure. If a CVS goes down, collaboratations cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. In the event of a crruption of a central database hard disk with the absence of backups, all work will be lost except for any portions on local machines
