# Links

- Links are created using the ```<a>``` element

- The ```<a>``` element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field. 

- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to. 

## Layout (pg. 358 - 404)

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box

- CSS positioning schemes (Normal Flow, Relative Positioning, Absolute Positioning, Fixed Positioning, Floating Elements)

## Functions

- Local Variables is created inside a function using the let keyword, it can only be used in that function

- Global Variables if you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script
