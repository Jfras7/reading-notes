# Programming With JavaScript

*Control Flow*
>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

*Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.*

**Loop**
>A loop is a sequence of instructions that continually repeated until a certain condition is met in computer programming. An example would be asking the user to give a number from 1-10 if the user gives a number outside of that range it the program will continue to ask till that number is met.

*Function*
>is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function. When a function is called, **arguments** are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return a value. A function in JavaScript is also an object. 

Overall JavaScript is a very popular coding language that is widely used in todays world. In fact over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior. JavaScript was originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.
