# Charts

- You are able to create charts. You are able to have a plugin that uses HTML5's canvas element to draw the graph.

- For example you can do line chart, pie chart, bar chart

## Basic Usage

- The canvas element only has two attributes, width and height. They can also be used to use DOM properties

- The `<canvas>` element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. In this tutorial, we focus on the 2D rendering context. 

## Shapes

- Before you start drawing you will need a coordinate space which would be the grid.
